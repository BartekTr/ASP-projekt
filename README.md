Project provides job offer management system.
There are three role of users: ordinary users, HR and admin.
Ordinary users can watch offers and after registration apply on.
HR can approve or reject application.
Admin can prescribe registered user to HR role of offer.

System works, but still needs some graphic improvement and tests, will be added soon.
