Project provides job offer management system.
There are three role of users: ordinary users, HR and admin.
Ordinary users can watch offers and after registration apply on.
HR can approve or reject application.
Admin can prescribe registered user to HR role of offer.

System works, but currently there is no possibility to attach CV, in the future user will have possibility to send pdf file which will be stored with Azure Storage Blob.
Beside that system still needs some graphic improvement and tests, will be added soon.
